## Overview

**Chilombo** is the official app of the Chilombo project, developed to facilitate cleaning service provision. Focused on accessibility, performance, and backend integration via API, the app efficiently connects clients and cleaning service providers. It uses modern navigation, authentication, optimized assets, and native integrations via Expo.

**Chilombo's Differentials:**

- **Accessibility:** Interface adapted for screen readers, enhanced contrast, and easy navigation for all audiences.
- **Performance:** Asset optimization, lazy loading of components, use of WebP images, and smooth animations with react-native-reanimated.
- **API REST Integration:** Robust and secure communication with the backend, including JWT authentication and real-time data updates.
- **Modern Navigation:** Uses expo-router for dynamic routes, deep linking, and smooth screen transitions.
- **Secure Authentication:** Integration with OAuth providers, secure token storage with expo-secure-store, and social login flows.
- **Native Integrations via Expo:** Push notifications, location access, secure storage, permissions, and device features.
- **Light/Dark Theme Support:** Automatic adaptation to system theme, with responsive and customizable design.
- **Offline Experience:** Data caching, offline fallback, and automatic sync when reconnecting.
- **Automated Testing:** Unit test coverage and continuous integration with Jest and Expo.
- **Advanced Security Practices:** Input validation, HTTPS communication, XSS protection, and use of encrypted storage.
